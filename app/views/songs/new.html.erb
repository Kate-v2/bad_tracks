<!-- Order here matters
    - 1st should be leading path
    - 2nd should be following path
    /artists/:artist_id/songs/new

    when we post this, it's posted to:
    /artists/:artist_id/songs

    - we now have :artist_id (via rails) and it's not functional with :id anymore
    - :id would now refer to the id of a song (for a song show page) because it comes last in the URL

<%= form_for [@artist, @song] do |f| %>

  <%= f.label :title %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>

  <%= f.label :length %>
  <%= f.number_field :length %>

  <%= f.label :play_count %>
  <%= f.number_field :play_count %>

  <%= f.submit %>
